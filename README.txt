Going into this project, our goal was to create an online, multiplayer clone of the popular Atari game, Combat. In this game, users control a tank on a two-dimensional arena with the goal of shooting the other tanks on the map. Using web sockets, the Crafty.js game engine, jQuery, and other useful web programming technologies, we have succeeded in creating a working game.

To run the game, simply navigate to the project directory containing app.js, and run the command “node app.js”. This will start the server and start accepting connections. To play the game, open a web browser and navigate to “localhost:3000.” At this point, you should be presented with a login screen with the option to register. You may register and make your own user information, or you could login with username: bill, password: password. You should now be all set to play the game. The controls are either the directional keys or “wasd”.
